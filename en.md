### Smartway | Software Architect | St.Petersburg, Russia | 2017
B2B SaaS for business trips. Web-project in which functionality expansion made it necessary to develop efficient complexity management and maintenance.

Reorganised service architecture and dev processes in a way that:
- system’s complexity should grow no faster than linear with functionality expansion;
- business has become less dependent on any single technology/platform and level of expertise of any one the team members;
- development process was less visible to users (continuous releases on hot-loaded system, etc.).

Following decisions were made:
- development and implementation of a transition from a monolithic to a service-oriented (microservice) architecture based on a cluster of Linux containers;
- implementation of a mechanism for service updates without stopping users’ work;
- backend components redesign;
- incorporation of new tools for a backend development: Go, Python, Linux containers

Transform to a distributed system is most often accompanied by a strong change in the infrastructure of the system as a whole, so main challenge for me was
- to prevent complexity of DevOps processes
- to minimise dependencies between components
- to provide flexible non-blocking integration of these components.

Technologies used: Go, .NET, MS SQL Server, MongoDB

I’ve been involved in infrastructure-significant tasks for EdTech platform «Dnevnik.ru».

Analysis and implementation of a geo-distributed data-intensive application without any IaaS or cloud providers. As a result, the load was decreased more than 30% and a resharding subsystem was incorporated. It allowed to redistribute data in DB cluster in a background, without sufficient data access locking.
